I'm a Software Engineer based in sunny [Cape Town, South Africa](https://www.capetown.travel/). I graduated from the [University of South Africa](https://www.unisa.ac.za/) in 2016 with a degree in Informatics. Since then, I've been trying to create accessible and performant products with delightful user experiences. My interests are in Front-end Engineering, but I enjoy diving into anything that results in a better product.

I'm currently working as a Senior Software Developer at [Full Facing](https://www.fullfacing.com/), where I spend most of my time working with wonderful people on [Lesson Desk](https://www.lessondesk.com/), [iFings](http://ifings.com/), [Gatekeeper](https://gatekeeper.fullfacing.com/) and the [new Radio Retail platform](http://www.zapop.com/service/radioretail/).

As my side hustle, I'm [bootstrapping a development agency with 2 close friends](https://www.andcru.io/). Recently we released the new [Varsity Vibe mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.varsityvibeapp) with the new website on its way!

In my free time, I like to read, play rugby, and spend time with my wife whom I love very dearly.

[I'm always open for a chat](/contact). Whether it is an awesome new project or to help someone new to Web development get started. I'm looking forward to hearing from you!
