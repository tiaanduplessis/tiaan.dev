### [Lesson Desk](https://www.lessondesk.com/) (March 2016 to current)

Lesson Desk is the largest e-learning platform in Africa, designed to train employees in a fun, digital and interactive format. I've been very active involed in the development of the Lesson Desk platform since end 2016. The platform has grown far larger than I could've ever imagined.

### [DigsConnect](https://www.digsconnect.com/) (June 2019 to August 2019)

Africa‚Äôs largest Student Accommodation platform. DigsConnect connects students with accommodation providers and with other students looking for accommodation. Here I was part of a two person team alongside [Pedre Viljoen](https://github.com/pedreviljoen) tasked with the development of a new version of the web app to migrate from the old Django website that uses jQuery to a new React SPA. In retrospect, I'm very proud of how we got everything done with such a tight deadline.
