As an employee, you should always try and keep your resume up to date. Set yourself a reminder to this at least every couple of months, not years.

Otherwise, you may fall into the trap of having to update your resume, but having no idea the details of everything you have accomplished. This can frequently happen when working for the same company for multiple years. Achievements that might have been significant and could carry a big impact on your resume might become blurred or completely forgotten e.g. With how much did I improve our site's web core vitals again?

I fell into the same trap and had to update my resume. After doing [some research](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=software+engineer+resume) regarding what is regarded as a good resume for a Software Engineer, I've landed on the following **[two column resume template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wks2zksi_jy8MeZRgjBGyo1DFChzMS0Edq9qvDw30xQ/edit?usp=sharing)**, heavily inspired by [Debarghya Das Resume](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume). I thought I'd share it as a baseline for anyone else faced with the same challenge.

The resume is very straight forward with no fancy styling. This makes it easier for the person reviewing it to scan the content as quickly as possible. if you are reviewing hundreds of resumes then a fancy display font and rainbow borders gets real old real quick.

To give it some flair, I'd also align the color scheme and font to that of the company I'm applying for and maybe include the company logo as a personal touch. Just don't go overboard. The resume is there to show what you can do, your cover letter should say why you are the right person.

If you are new to software engineering and don't have any work experience yet, swap that section out with projects you are worked on, describing what technical challenges you faced and what you used. Just remember to include links as well. People want to see what you've built.

You can also expand on the education section with marks achieved, clubs participated in, rewards received, etc.

**Pro tip**: As you update your resume, implement a versioning system like the one built into Google Docs or create a separate document to retain previous details that were on your resume. You never know when you want to add some information back in based on the role you are applying for.
